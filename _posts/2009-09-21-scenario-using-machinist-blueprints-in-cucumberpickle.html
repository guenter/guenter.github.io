Given you have two blueprints for users:

{% highlight ruby %}
User.blueprint {}
User.blueprint(:admin) {}
{% endhighlight %}

Then this is how you reference them from a Cucumber feature definition:

{% highlight cucumber %}
Given a user exists
Given an admin_user exists
{% endhighlight %}


Took me some digging into the Pickle code to find that out.

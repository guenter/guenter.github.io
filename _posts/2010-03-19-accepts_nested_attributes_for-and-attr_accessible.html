In your model, if you have

{% highlight ruby %}
accepts_nested_attributes_for :attachments
{% endhighlight %}

And you limit the accessible attributes with something like

{% highlight ruby %}
attr_accessible :title, :text
{% endhighlight %}

make sure to also include the virtual attribute for the nested model to that list, like so:

{% highlight ruby %}
attr_accessible :title, :text, :attachments_attributes
{% endhighlight %}

Otherwise, your model won't accept the nested attributes.
